    lede: "Exercisable answerability distinguishes being formally assigned responsibility from actually being able to answer for what has been done. A person or institution is answerable only when it can reconstruct the relevant judgment, explain why the reasons counted as they did, defend the ordering under challenge, and revise the conclusion when those reasons fail. Responsibility can therefore remain nominally human while the conditions required to exercise it have migrated into systems, procedures, or infrastructures that no individual can adequately reconstruct.",

          "It is possible to be responsible on paper and unanswerable in practice. Org charts, job titles, and signature fields assign responsibility; they do not guarantee that the person who bears it can actually discharge it. Exercisable answerability is what separates the two.",
          "The distinction matters because automation is often introduced under the assurance that a human remains in charge. But remaining in charge is not the same as being able to answer. The human may be the last node in a chain whose earlier links — the thresholds, rankings, and categories that shaped the decision — have already been settled out of reach.",

It is to reconstruct the judgment that produced it: to show why the reasons counted as they did, to defend the ordering under challenge, and to revise the conclusion when those reasons fail. These are not procedural formalities; they are the conditions that make responsibility a real standing rather than an empty label.",
          "When these conditions are distributed across systems that no one person can traverse, the formal assignment of responsibility becomes a kind of fiction. The responsible party is left saying, in effect, that the system decided — and saying it in the first person does not make it a judgment.",

Each step may be defensible on its own. Cumulatively, they move the institutional capacity to answer into infrastructure that no individual can reconstruct.",

      "A single walk through the working vocabulary of the programme — inferential license, judgment gap, second-order provenance, the partition thesis, ethical disclosure, comparative entitlement formation, post-mimetic relationality, epistemic infrastructure, systemic friction, and automated certainty — and how each concept depends on the others.",
    lede: "The concepts developed in this programme are not a glossary. They are the joints of one argument about what has to be in place before a decision can count as a judgment for which someone is answerable — and what happens to those conditions when the work of deciding is redistributed into infrastructure.",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Where the argument begins: license, not accuracy",
        paragraphs: [
          "The programme does not begin with the question of whether automated systems reason well. It begins one step earlier, with the question of who is permitted to draw a conclusion at all, in what setting, and to whom they must answer. That permission is what inferential license names: a normative standing, not a cognitive capacity.",
          "Once license is in view, a familiar puzzle changes shape. A system that outputs a correct conclusion has not thereby acquired the standing to conclude. What automation does is not principally to accelerate inference but to relocate license — quietly, and usually without anyone deciding that it should be relocated.",
          "The judgment gap is the direct consequence. It is the interval between what a system produces and what the same act would require in order to be a judgment someone owns. The gap does not close with better accuracy. It closes only when the act is returned to a structure in which addressability, stake, and standing can be recovered — which is why human-in-the-loop arrangements so often fail: they seat a person at the end of a process from which the conditions of judgment have already been stripped.",

          "If judgment is to be owned, its normative footing must be traceable. First-order provenance tells us where data came from. Second-order provenance asks the harder question: where did the orderings come from that make those data matter — the threshold, the ranking, the category that turned an output into something decisive?",
          "Systems routinely satisfy the first requirement while failing the second. Every input is documented; no addressable party ever authored the ordering under which the output counts. An institution in that position cannot answer for the decisions its systems produce, however complete its audit trail.",

          "The partition thesis performs a separation that normative theory tends to blur. Criteria of moral standing settle who enters the moral field. They do not, by themselves, generate any priority among those admitted. Standing is a threshold notion; ordering is a relational one.",
          "Conflating them produces two symmetrical errors: treating admission as if it entailed priority, and treating disputes about ordering as if they were disputes about standing. Debates about the moral status of artificial systems are a live case, and the thesis is developed against the most inclusive standing criteria available precisely because even they supply no internal principle of priority.",

          "This is where mediation does its quietest work. A system can foreclose disclosure without contradicting a single ethical principle: nothing arrives as a claim in the first place, so nothing is violated.

These environments do not merely display inequality; they format it as entitlement, whose frustration then has a recognisable and monetisable affective shape.",
          "Post-mimetic relationality names the wider configuration this belongs to. Mimetic dynamics classically presuppose co-presence and reciprocity. When desire is routed through infrastructures that measure, aggregate, and re-serve it, the resulting relations resemble mimetic ones but have lost their bidirectional character. That residue is neither individual psychology nor a network effect, and it deserves a name of its own.",

AI systems both depend on this scaffolding and reshape it, inheriting its categories while altering the practices that produced them. That reflexive loop is not anticipated by classical accounts of evidence, and it is why questions of bias and trust belong to arrangements rather than to models.",
          "Systemic friction is the companion concept. Delay, checkpointing, redundancy, and dispute are not simply inefficiencies; they create the temporal and relational room in which judgment and answerability are exercised. Automation frequently succeeds precisely by removing them, and the resulting system may be faster, cheaper, and less answerable at once. Institutional inversion follows: the organisation reorganises itself around what the automated system can do.",

Where inferential license and the judgment gap concern the structure of the act, automated certainty concerns its formation: what happens to a person's calibration when interpretive difficulty is removed on their behalf, and the friction that would have taught them to doubt has been designed away.",
